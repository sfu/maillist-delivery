This directory contains files used by the maillist delivery scripts. 
It is intended to be deployed to /opt/mail/maillist2

mld.conf - Config file which is read by mld.pl. (See file for description
           of config items.)

mld.pid  - mld.pl writes its process id in this file when it starts up.

mlqueue/ - Directory where messages sent to mailing lists are queued for 
           delivery. The /opt/bin/mlq.pl script writes the messages in this
           directory (one subdirectory per message), and the mld.pl script
           reads this directory and delivers, then deletes, each message.

files/   - Cached maillist info. Each maillist has a subdirectory, containing
           files with maillist attributes, members, and allowed/denied senders.
           Maintianed by the mlupdate.pl script.

bin/     - Maillist scripts and perl modules. (See bin/README for description.)

templates/  - Email templates used by the /opt/bin/mlproxy.pl script.

logs/    - Directory where log files for mld.pl and mlupdate.pl are kept.

         mld.log  - STDOUT and STDERR for mld.pl. Normal messages related to message
                    processing is written to syslog. This log contains messages related
                    to the running of the mld.pl script itself.

         mlupdt.log - STDOUT and STDERR for mlupdate.pl.
