Scripts for Mail server management
 - maillist: all scripts related to maillist delivery, including the actual delivery code
      as well as the scripts that keep the maillist membership files up to date.
 - mail: scripts primarily related to mail delivery and queue mgmt. 
         Most scripts here will be symlinked from /etc/smrsh
 - bin: scripts to fetch data from Amaint to keep mail server Aliases db files up to date.
        Also includes the quarantine daemon for managing the server itself

This git repo can be run from wherever it's installed, but ensure the paths in lib/Paths.pm has
the correct paths for where data is to be stored. These must agree with where Sendmail looks
for aliases and where cron entries point for scripts that are run at regular intervals

It is recommended that you keep the git repo separate from the data store. E.g.

/opt/amaint - this git repo
/opt/mail - root for mail data, including aliases files. Maillist data would then go in /opt/mail/maillist2
