Leaving these test scripts here for now, but the preferred method of testing now
will be to deploy code to mailgw-stage server and test full delivery. From there,
SFU recipients will receive mail in email-stage.sfu.ca environment and external
users' mail will be trapped by proofpoint-stage.its.sfu.ca and stored in 
outbound quarantine.
