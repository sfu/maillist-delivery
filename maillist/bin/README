This directory contains scripts which comprise part of the maillist delivery system. Please see the ICAT wiki entry for the official documentation of the 
maillist system. 

mld.pl - The maillist delivery script. This script is started at boot time 
         (see /etc/init.d/local) and manages the maillist queue at 
         /opt/mail/maillist2/mlqueue, forking child processes to handle 
         delivery of individual messages. 
         See the comments in the script and "mld.pl -h" for runtime arguments.
         See /opt/mail/maillist2/mld.conf for config information.

mldstop  - Script which is run at shutdown to stop the mld.pl process. It sends
           a QUIT signal to mld.pl, which then waits for any children to 
           finish before exiting.

mlupdate.pl - Run periodically via cron to update the cached maillist info in
              /opt/mail/maillist2/files. It is also run via inetd - when a 
              maillist is changed in Maillist2.woa, a connection is made from
              garibaldi* to port 6087, and the name of the maillist is supplied
              on STDIN. mlupdate.pl then updates the information for that 
              maillist.

mllockstat.pl - Run hourly via cron to check for messages stuck in the queue.
                It checks for .lock files which are older than an hour and
                emails a warning to amaint@sfu.ca.

cleanmllogs - Script which cleans up old log files in /opt/mail/maillist2/logs.
              Run nightly via cron.

MLD.pm - Module which contains subroutines used by mld.pl which actually do 
         the message delivery.

MLUpdt.pm - Module used by mlupdate.pl.

MLUtil.pm - Module containing some useful utility functions used by other
            modules.

LOCK.pm - Module with locking routines used by other scripts and modules.

MLMail.pm - Module with utility functions for manipulating email addresses.

MLCache.pm - Module which defines an MLCache object, which represents the cached
             information for a maillist.

Aliases.pm - Module with utility functions for handling aliases.

util/    Directory with some useful scripts for debugging.
     allowedToSend.pl - Give this script a listname and sender address on the 
                        command line and it will return the "allowedToSend"
                        value and how it was calculated.
     mldbmlist.pl     - Give this script a listname and it will print the 
                        maillist attributes from the local cache.
                        
See also /usr/local/bin/mlq.pl, which is the agent run by sendmail when mail
is sent to a maillist. It puts the messages in the mailllist queue.

test/   Directory which contains some useful scripts for testing. See test/README for more info.
